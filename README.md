# Astronomical League Arp Peculiar Galaxy (Northern) Observing Program

Some resources for observation planning.

## Project setup

If you'd like to run the notebook locally, you can do so by following these steps:

1. Clone this repository
2. cd into the cloned repository
2. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` (within a virtual environment if desired)
3. Run `jupyterlab` to start the Jupyter Lab server
4. Open the notebook `Arp_Peculiar_Galaxies.ipynb` in Jupyter Lab

## Introduction

> "When looked at closely enough, every galaxy is peculiar" – Halton Arp

This Astronomical League Observing Program is based on the 338 objects found in
the Arp Catalog of Peculiar Galaxies. One hundred of the 338 Arp galaxies must
be observed or imaged to qualify for the Program’s certificate and pin (if
a pin was not already given for the completion of the Southern Arp Observing
Program). Please remember, though, before you start this program, that it was
developed for advanced amateurs, and may not be suitable for beginners. For
observers and astrophotographers, a majority of the 338 galaxies fall in the
12th to 18th magnitude range. However, there are over 100 Arp objects below
magnitude 13.5.
